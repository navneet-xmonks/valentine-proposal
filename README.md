## Deployment

This site is configured for automatic deployment with Vercel. Every commit pushed to the `main` branch will trigger a production deployment.

### Vercel Setup

The repository includes a `vercel.json` configuration file that:
- Enables clean URLs (removes `.html` extensions)
- Configures the site as a static HTML/CSS/JS project
- Ensures automatic deployments from the main branch

To set up Vercel deployment:
1. Import this repository in your Vercel dashboard
2. Connect it to your GitHub account
3. Set the production branch to `main`
4. Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to main
